# BC_Assignment_2
VBA Assignment

In this repository, I have two .bas files for the final submission.
In order to get the expected results, please run the macro called TickerSummary (Part1of2_Assignment_FO) first, followed by the macro called SecondSummary (Part2of2_Assignment_FO).

I split the code into two modules as excel was freezing when I tried to add all the code in one module. After confirmation from the tutors, it was confirmed that slitting the code would be acceptable as well.

I also attached screenshots of how my tables look like in all three sheets, only the top part as the data set was quite large.

Thank you for reviewing!
