# BC_Assignment_2
VBA Assignment

In this repository, I have two .bas files for the final submission.
In order to get the expected results, please run the macro called TickerSummary (Part1of2_Assignment_FO) first, followed by the macro called SecondSummary (Part2of2_Assignment_FO).

I split the code into two modules as excel was freezing when I tried to add all the code in one module. After confirmation from the tutors, it was confirmed that slitting the code would be acceptable as well.

To troubleshoot an error, I took help from outside of the curriculum. This is with regards to the 'On Error Resume Next'. I got the Interior ColorIndex for red and green color from Stack Overflow and the code for MATCH in the second part of the code is from the Microsoft website as I could not find a reference in the lectures and exercises.   

I also attached screenshots of how my tables look like in all three sheets; only the top part as the data set was quite large.

Thank you for reviewing!
